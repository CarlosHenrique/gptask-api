This will guide the model towards the desired output, and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt. In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which can lead to more detailed and relevant outputs."}],
